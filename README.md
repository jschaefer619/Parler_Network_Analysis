# Introduction

On January 6th, 2021, a group of right-wing Insurrectionists stormed the US Capitol. The Insurrectionists were able to breach the US Captiol Building itself, leading to the evacuation of the Senate and House Chambers. Five people died and over 140 were injured (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/08/capitol-attack-police-officer-five-deaths).

The role of the right wing social media website Parler was instrumental in the planning and publicity of the Insurrection. Many Parler users expressed pro-trump, violent sentiment on the Platform. In response to Parler's culpability in this event, Amazon Web Services dropped support for managing parler's cloud infrastrucure. This led to a month long disruption in Parler's service, though the social media provider is not back online.

# Purpose of this Project

Though Parler may be back online, virtually all of the posts from the Riots are now no longer on the Parler Platform. This is a shame - these posts provide critical insight to a traumatic national event. Fortunately, savvy, self-proclaimed online hacktivists scraped the parler website for text and videos during the Insurrection. The videos from Parler have been coupled with open source facial identification software to hold the insurrectionists accountable.

This project uses the textual information from Parler to accomplish two things:

1) Compile an cleaned, accessable dataset of the Parler textual data
2) Build a online network analysis tool to allow users to critically engage with the conversations on Parler

## Close Reading

In this project, I will provide some visualizations that allows users to engage with the corpus as a whole. However, I do beleive that many users have already had the oppurtinuity to engae with the voices on Parler through an abstracted, mediated manner. No doubt, many people reading this have already read many of the excellent articles and think pieces by people far more knowledgeable than myself. So I hope to accomplish something unique with this project: allow users to engage with the texts of the Insurrectionist firsthand, in a manner that emulates their networked strucure. I hope to remove some of the abstraction and mediation from this Parler data - and I do hope this will be insightful in some way. Users should be warned: the content that will be viewed in this way does contain strong language and hate speech.
